# serverless-step-function

I intended to delete log on step machine console, but mistaken delete a state machine on client test. Shoot... 

I tried to rerun existing pipeline, it doesn't work because that state machine no longer exist.

I tried to modified state machine defination, redeploy, it is still erorring state machine no longer exist so it can't update new changes.

I told my manager and they fixed but I did not ask how they did it.

That led me to write this repo and feed my curiosity. And, Finally, I am able to fix this, and here what I did.

1. Change name of a state machine, push to master, and wait until cloud formation create a brand new state machine.
2. Rename that same state machine, push to master, and redeploy it.
3. That's it. You got your exact same state machine before.
